.SH DESCRIPTION
Shed Skin is an experimental Python\-to\-C++ compiler designed to speed up the execution of Python programs. It converts programs written in a static subset of Python to C++. The C++ code can be compiled to executable code, which can be run either as a standalone program or as a module imported and called from CPython.


.SH LIMITATIONS
(See the documentation for a more detailed overview.)


.TP 3
1.
Variables must be (implicitly) statically typed. Abstract types (as in C++) are supported.


.TP 3
2.
