#summary Possible tasks for helping out with Shed Skin

= Upgrade MingW =

The MingW contained in the Windows package is getting old. The MingW project has not yet upgraded to g++ 4.x, but there is at least one fork that is more uptodate (TODO: insert link)

= Improve Support for Non-common Exceptions =

Currently, Shed Skin does not support Exceptions such as SystemExit, ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError and the like.

= Cleanup file, cStringIO, pipes code =

cStringIO and os.popen_pipe (in the future) both inherit from file. the corresponding code hierarchy on the C++ side is a bit ugly and probably extremely inefficient.

= Replace set implementation with something faster = 

the hash set used in Shed Skin is not as good as the one in CPython, especially for unions, intersections and such. in part, CPython is fast for these methods, because it avoids rehashing all the time (directly works with underlying hashtable). 

= Optimize builtins, especially str =

there are many places in lib/builtin.?pp that can still be optimized further, especially for str.

= Improve 'os' support =

especially under windows.

= Code Review =

the compiler source code is a bit messy. an extra pair of hands to perform minor cleanups and refactoring would be very useful.
