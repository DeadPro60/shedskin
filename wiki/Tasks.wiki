#summary Possible tasks for helping out with Shed Skin

= Upgrade MingW =

The MingW contained in the Windows package is getting old. The MingW project has not yet upgraded to g++ 4.x, but there is at least one fork that is more uptodate (TODO: insert link)

= Extension Module Improvements =

keyword arguments should be relatively easy to add.

= Improve Support for Non-common Exceptions =

Currently, Shed Skin does not support Exceptions such as SystemExit, ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError and the like.

= Cleanup file, cStringIO, pipes code =

cStringIO and os.popen_pipe (in the future) both inherit from file. the corresponding code hierarchy on the C++ side is a bit ugly and probably extremely inefficient.

= Optimize builtins =

there are many places in lib/builtin.?pp that can still be optimized further.

= Improve 'os' support =

some functionality missing under Windows.

= Code Review =

the compiler source code is a bit messy. an extra pair of hands to perform minor cleanups and refactoring would be very useful.

= Dict rewrite = 

(this one is a bit difficult). rewrite the dict implementation in lib/builtin.?pp based on the cpython code, like ffao did for the set implementation.

= Use c++ library for str =

(this one is a bit difficult). rip out the str implementation and replace it with a python-compatible C++ library, if such a thing exists. that would certainly clean things up, and solve many efficiency problems.
