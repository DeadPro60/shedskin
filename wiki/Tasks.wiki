= Upgrade MingW =

The MingW contained in the Windows package is getting old. The MingW project has not yet upgraded to g++ 4.x, but there is at least one fork that is more uptodate (TODO: insert link)

= Improve Extension Module Support = 

Extension modules are currently quite limited; there is no support for custom classes, or classes such as collections.defaultdict, and calls can be quite slow because of recursive copying.
