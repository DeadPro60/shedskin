#summary Changes for 0.4

= Done =

-support for generator expressions 

-first-class support for booleans (so they print as 'True', for example) 

-support for the 'key' argument of 'min' and 'max'

-new examples: 

  -pylife (by david bau, based on the wonderful hashlife algorithm)

  -a-star/pygame algorithm

-several improvements to 'defaultdict' (for example, support for 'defaultdict(None, ..)')

-improved partial support for '**kwargs' in lib/

-resolved some licensing issues for time.strptime and string hashing implementations

-pass defaultdicts to/from extension modules

-support for open('U')

-support 'dict([[1,1]])' and similar 

-support for 'bin'

-support for 'math.factorial'

-random.seed: support None or hashable argument

= Todo =

-support for __iter__ methods (the analysis part works fine already)

-add memoryview support or similar, for easier integration with numpy and such

-examples/life.py seems to trigger an infinite loop in TI, and worse, results are imprecise after the maximum number of iterations

-improve IO speed

-investigate whether GC is not scanning lists/tuples of integers at the moment, which is pointless if there are no secret pointers in there. (for sets of ints, GC is already disabled specifically)

-fix GCC warnings that occur when enabling all warnings

-what happens on 'raise SystemExit'?

-hashing of floats is different from CPython; printing of floats is close, but not perfect.

-fix issue 53 (it looks like we may be forced to add some kind of type
declarations to lib/ to solve this.. though ugly it would be
relatively simple to do).

-(list.)sort(ed) calls the 'key' argument more often than CPython
