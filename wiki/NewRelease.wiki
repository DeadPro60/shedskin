#summary Changes for 0.4

= Done =

-support for generator expressions 

-first-class support for booleans (so they print as 'True', for example) 

-support for the 'key' argument of 'min' and 'max'

-dropped windows support

-new examples: 

  -pylife (by david bau, based on the wonderful hashlife algorithm)

  -a-star/pygame algorithm

-fix issue 53: casting to builtins when type inference is not enough

-examples/life.py: randomize TI a bit, to avoid getting stuck

-heapq.{merge,nsmallest,nlargest} 

-several improvements to 'defaultdict' (for example, support for 'defaultdict(None, ..)')

-improved partial support for '**kwargs' in lib/

-resolved some licensing issues for time.strptime and string hashing implementations

-pass defaultdicts to/from extension modules

-support for open('U')

-support 'dict([[1,1]])' and similar 

-support for 'bin'

-support for 'math.factorial'

-random.seed: support None or hashable argument

-fix many GCC warnings that occur when enabling all warnings

-improvements for SystemExit

= Moved to later release, or if someone volunteers = 

-support for __iter__ methods (the analysis part works fine already)

-investigate whether GC is not scanning lists/tuples of integers at the moment, which is pointless if there are no secret pointers in there. (for sets of ints, GC is already disabled specifically)

-improve IO speed

-(list.)sort(ed) calls the 'key' argument more often than CPython

-add memoryview support or similar, for easier integration with numpy and such
