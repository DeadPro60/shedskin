#summary Release notes

= Shed Skin 0.2 =

- 7 new example programs (some removed, now 40 in total):

  -disco: an simple Monte Carlo + UCT go player (368 lines, mark dufour)

  -a more advanced voronoi algorithm (795 lines; steve fortune, bill simons)

  -a nicer neural network implementation (raymond hettinger, jeff hinrichs)

  -TSP approximation using ant colonies (eric rollins)

  -Lempel-Ziv compressor (david mackay)

  -huffman block compressor (david mackay)

  -arithmetic coding compressor (david mackay)

- many inlining optimizations

- huge speedups for 'for .., .. in enumerate/zip(sequence, [sequence])' 
  
- important TI fix (involving default arguments)

- fixes for 'import as' 
 
- follow module initialization order

- optimized 'len(list)' (remove virtual call)

- optimized list slicing (when step is 1)

- drop compatibility with 2.3, follow 2.6 implementation

- fysphun example now uses an extension module

- _ is not a special-case variable anymore (could be dynamic before)

- cleanup compiler core further, removing about 100 lines again

- many minor bugfixes

= Shed Skin 0.1.1 = 

-five new example programs:

  -minilight: advanced raytracer (triangle primitives, octree spatial index)

  -peter norvig's sudoku solver (solves top 95 difficult ones in under 10 seconds)

  -interactive circle packing algorithm (pygame + compiled extension module)

  -ao bench: ambient occlusion benchmark

  -mastermind strategy evaluator

-removal of generic type support (nice, but rarely useful)

  -no need for command-line option -i anymore

  -compiler core is now 10% smaller (from 7700 to under 7000 lines)

  -weird templates would confuse user

-traditional important TI fixes (disappearing types, non-termination)

-compiler should use about 25% less memory and CPU time

-huge refactoring for readability in infer.py and cpp.py

-extmod fixes:

  -incref None, so it doesn't get deallocated

  -accept None when converting to custom class instance

-new command-line option -r, for faster random number generator (C rand())

-bounds checking is now on by default (for compatibility), -b now turns it off

-many minor bug fixes/improvements
