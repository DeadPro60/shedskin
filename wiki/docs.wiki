= Introduction =

**Shed Skin** is an experimental **Python-to-C++ compiler** designed to speed up the execution of computation-intensive Python programs. It converts programs written in a restricted subset of Python to C++. The C++ code can be compiled to executable code, which can be run either as a standalone program or as an extension module easily imported and used in a regular Python program.

**Shed Skin** uses type inference techniques to determine the implicit types used in a Python program, in order to generate the explicit type declarations needed in a C++ version. Because C++ is statically typed, **Shed Skin** requires Python code to be written such that all variables are (implicitly!) statically typed.

Besides the typing and subset restrictions, supported programs cannot freely use the Python standard library, although 22 common modules are supported, such as `random` and `re` (see [docs#Library_Limitations Library Limitations]).

Additionally, the type inference techniques employed by **Shed Skin** currently do not scale very well beyond several thousand lines of code (the largest compiled program is about 3,000 lines (sloccount)). In all, this means that **Shed Skin** is currently mostly useful to compile smallish programs and extension modules, that do not make extensive use of dynamic Python features or the standard or external libraries.

Because **Shed Skin** is still in an early stage of development, it can also improve a lot. At the moment, you will probably run into some bugs when using it. Please report these, so they can be fixed!

At the moment, **Shed Skin** is compatible with Python versions 2.4 to 2.7, behaves like 2.6, and should work on Windows and most UNIX platforms, such as GNU/Linux and OSX. On UNIX platforms, GCC version 4.2 or higher is required to compile the resulting C++ code.
