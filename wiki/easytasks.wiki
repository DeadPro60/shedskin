= improve IO speed =

IO in shedskin is SLOW. file IO (file, pipes, cStringIO) is currently per-character. print speed can also still be much improved (this is more difficult though).

= string formatting performance =

the important __modfill function in lib/builtin.cpp can probably become a lot faster by building the result in one go, instead of using many intermediate allocations.

= refactoring =

many places in the shedskin python code are in need of some serious refactoring. just browsing through the code will show lots of code that does more or less the same thing. some parts may not be used anymore, etc. etc.

= extension module improvements =

we could use more tests (see tests/run.py). support for class-level attributes and properties would be nice.

= exception hierarchy =

there's some low-hanging fruit here, for example de-duplicate stuff between OSError and IOError.

= string support =

profile and optimize commonly used string methods
